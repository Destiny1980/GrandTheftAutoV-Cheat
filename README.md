## Getting started
### Prerequisites
To run the software, [the latest](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0) Microsoft Visual Studio C++ redistributable package must be installed. If you regularly play video games these are most likely already installed on your system.

### Using the software
1. Download the latest precompiled version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/HatchesPls/GrandTheftAutoV-Cheat/releases)
3. Use your favorite module injector to inject the cheat file into GTA5.exe. It is important to inject using the Windows LoadLibrary method without any obfuscation or post injection cleanup, the cheat does **not** work when the cheat is manually mapped into the game process. If you don't know about any good module injectors, see [this](https://github.com/HatchesPls/SimpleModuleInjector) Github repository.
